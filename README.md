 this is a WIP project. 
 This project is me just experimenting with procedural generation and seeing what i can do. id love to get feedback on things i should change or improve upon.

the executable can be found in the bin.

if you wish to edit and compile the source code the tasks.json build task for VSCode is set up to use the mingw-w64 compiler
